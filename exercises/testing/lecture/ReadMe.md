# SwEng: in-class exercises on testing

```
# === Windows ===
# compile + run tests + get code coverage
gradlew.bat build
# compile + run the main method
gradlew.bat run

# === Linux / macOS (incl. Windows Subsystem for Linux) ===
# same comments as above
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

You can (and should) use your favorite development environment to do these exercises, for instance:
- In IntelliJ (and Android Studio), select "Open" and pick this folder
- In Eclipse, use the File menu >> Import >> Gradle >> Existing Gradle Project, and pick this folder
